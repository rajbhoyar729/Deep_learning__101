## Introduction

This repository is a collection of projects that I will be working on as part of my learning process in deep learning. Each project will include detailed descriptions, code, and results. The aim is to cover a wide range of topics, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and more.

## Projects

### Future Projects

- **Project 1:** Coming soon!
- **Project 2:** Coming soon!
- **Project 3:** Coming soon!
- More projects will be added here as they are completed.

Stay tuned for updates!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, and others as needed.

## Installation

To clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Deep_learning__101.git
cd Deep_learning__101
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
Once projects are added, navigate to the respective project directory and execute the main script. For example:

Copy code
```bash
cd project_1_directory
python main.py
```
Each project folder will contain a README file with specific instructions for running the project.
